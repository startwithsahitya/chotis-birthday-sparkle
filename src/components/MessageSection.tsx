            <p className="text-foreground">
              First things first — I just want to say how grateful and lucky I
              am that I met you and that we share a part of our lives together.
              Before I met you, honestly, I was that “non-care, non-self-aware”
              type of guy jo bahut gaaliyaan deta tha and wasn’t really the
              person you’d look up to or talk to. But ever since we started
              sharing this bhai-behen waala bond, I’ve felt a sense of
              responsibility. Not in some big dramatic way, but more like —
              someone is looking up to me, talking to me, sharing a part of
              their life — toh mujhe thoda presentable toh banna hi chahiye.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground">
              Slowly-slowly, in that sense of responsibility, I’ve changed for
              the better. And I’m honestly grateful you were that change point.
              If I look back at my old self in videos, I don’t even like that
              guy — and that’s a good thing because it means I’ve grown. Thank
              you for being part of my life and helping me change in a subtle
              but impactful way.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground">
              Also, before you, I’d never really talked to any “ladiezzz” on
              Insta or anywhere — didn’t even know how to interact. Agar woh
              interhouse wala event nahi hota and I didn’t talk to juniors, I
              think my personality in this area wouldn’t have developed at all.
              From that incident onwards, when we interacted, it felt like I was
              exploring a new side of my personality, getting a new and positive
              perspective on life. And that’s all thanks to you — seriously,
              you’ve been such a positive impact.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground">
              Now, about you — you’re cute, chotti, someone you just want to
              pamper &#123;I mean jaise dogs ke baal pe sehlaate hai waise — not
              calling you a dog 😆&#125;, very sensitive yet strong, caring,
              ambitious — and I truly admire that. I can’t even put in perfect
              words how much I appreciate these qualities. Just know that I mean
              it when I say you’re special.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground">
              As your brother, I want you to grow, succeed, and be independent
              in whatever field you choose. Sometimes, I might sound protective
              or my thoughts might not match yours — but chhota-mota faaltu ka
              bada-bhai gyaan dena mera farz hai. So here goes:
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground">
              <strong>1&#41;</strong> Don’t expect your happiness or feelings to
              depend on others — whether it’s birthdays or any day. Life is
              mostly about you making yourself happy. Main hamesha tumhare saath
              rahun yeh zaroori nahi hoga, so learn to feel independent —
              Independence is not about buying clothes or roaming around, but in
              how you handle happiness, sadness, and decisions without depending
              on anyone. The world doesn’t revolve around us individually, and
              that’s okay.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground">
              <strong>2&#41;</strong> Sometimes, things you wish for won’t turn
              into reality. That’s fine. Give your best, accept what comes, and
              keep giving yourself reality checks.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground">
              I’m not saying all this to upset you on your birthday — this is
              just me wishing the best for you. The earlier you realize these
              things, the sooner you’ll become the best version of yourself. I
              hope and wish you graduate as a doctor and achieve every dream you
              have.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground">
              And yes — don’t take life too seriously. Enjoy it. Pooja-vuja
              karo, cherish every moment, and make sure you’re not hurting
              anyone in the process.
            </p>

            <p className="text-primary font-medium">
              Happy Birthday, my dear sister! May all your wishes come true!
